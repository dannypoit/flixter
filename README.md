Creating a user will allow you to enroll in courses, pay enrollment fees, and keep track of all the courses in which you are enrolled. It will also allow them to create their own courses that they can then offer for sale to other users.

## Viewing a course

To view courses, users can click either 'See All Courses' at the top left or 'Browse Courses' in the middle of the hero section.

The course details page will show you the lessons available for that course, but you will not be able to view the lesson material unless you are enrolled in the course.

To enroll in the course, click 'Pay with Card'. A pop-up window will open in which you can enter your credit card information to pay for the course.

**PLEASE NOTE: The payment module is currently in test mode, but please do not enter actual credit card information at this time.**

Once paid, the user will be enrolled in the course and will be able to view the lessons.

The user can returned to a course they are enrolled in at any time by navigating to it or by clicking 'Dashboard' from the top right, which will show them only the courses in which they are enrolled.

Then, you can add Sections and Lessons. Sections are groups of lessons that only have a title. Lessons have a title, subtitle, and a video file. You can also 'Preview as student...' to see what the course will look like to students.
